Extract academic citations from Wikipedia
=========================================
This project contains a utility for extracting academic citation identifiers.

**NOTE:** As one of its dependencies (`Mediawiki-Utilities <https://github.com/halfak/Mediawiki-Utilities>`_) requires
Python 3 so does mwcites.

``pip install mwcites``

Usage
-----
There's really only one utility in this package called ``mwcitations``.

::

    $ mwcitations extract enwiki-20150112-pages-meta-history*.xml*.bz2 > citations.tsv


Documentation

Documentation is provided ``$ mwcitations extract -h``.
